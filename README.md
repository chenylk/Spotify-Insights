# Spotify-Insights

## This was a quick excercise to get more exposure to API calls. I used spotify's API to pull in the top 50 songs in America and split the data into the top 10 songs and the rest of the 40 songs that comprise the top 50. The spotify song attributes were used to compare those in the top 10 vs the rest to see if there were any trends with what made those certain songs so popular. I will be revisiting this code over time to see if these attributes change. Below are three graphs that show significant differences in an attribute between the two classes of songs. The top ten songs was more "speechy" but less "acoustic" and "instrumental" compared to the rest of the top 50 songs.
